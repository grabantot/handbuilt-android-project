# handbuilt-android-project

This is a MODIFIED BY ME companion project to NOT my blog post [Jack, Jill & building Android apps by hand](http://czak.pl/2016/05/31/handbuilt-android-project.html).

I'm exploring building an Android app "by hand" (i.e. without and IDE or Gradle even).

For the tl;dr version, see the [Makefile](Makefile)

Modifications: uses javac+dx instead of jack to compile, dependency management removed (was unable to make curl work for me)
